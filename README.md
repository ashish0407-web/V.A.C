# V.A.C - Voice-Operated Calculator

## Overview
**V.A.C (Voice-Operated Calculator)** is an innovative Python-based application designed to perform mathematical calculations through voice commands. This user-friendly tool leverages speech recognition and natural language processing to interpret and execute spoken arithmetic operations. It simplifies calculations by eliminating the need for manual input, making it an ideal solution for accessibility and convenience.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Understands spoken commands for arithmetic operations.
- **Supports Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid inputs and provides feedback for unsupported commands.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with audio feedback.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For voice input processing.
- **Pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech audio feedback.
- **NumPy**: For precise mathematical computations.

## Installation
To set up and run V.A.C on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vac-voice-calculator.git
   cd vac-voice-calculator
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application by running `main.py`.
2. Speak your arithmetic query clearly into your microphone (e.g., "What is 15 plus 7?").
3. V.A.C will process your query and provide the result via text and audio feedback.
4. To exit, simply say "exit" or "quit."

## Example Commands
- "What is 25 plus 10?"
- "Multiply 6 by 7."
- "Divide 100 by 4."
- "Subtract 8 from 50."
